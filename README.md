# CRI Resource Manager for Kubernetes

## Introduction

CRI Resource Manager is a Container Runtime Interface Proxy. It sits between 
clients and the actual Container Runtime implementation (containerd, cri-o,
dockershim+docker), relaying requests and responses back and forth. The main
purpose of the proxy is to apply hardware-aware resource allocation policies
to the containers running in the system.

Policies are applied by either modifying a request before forwarding it, or
by performing extra actions related to the request during its processing and
proxying. There are several policies available, each with a different set of
goals in mind and implementing different hardware allocation strategies. The
details of whether and how a CRI request is altered or if extra actions are
performed depend on which policy is active in CRI Resource Manager, and how
that policy is configured.

The current goal for the CRI Resource Manager is to prototype and experiment
with new Kubernetes container placement policies. The existing policies are
written with this in mind and the intended setup is for the Resource Manager
to only act as a proxy for the Kubernetes Node Agent, kubelet.


## TL;DR Setup

If you want to give CRI Resource Manager a try, here is the list of things
you need to do, assuming you already have a Kubernetes cluster up and running,
using either `containerd` or `cri-o` as the runtime.

  1. Set up kubelet to use CRI Resource Manager as the runtime.
  2. Set up CRI Resource Manager to use the runtime with a policy.

For kubelet you do this by altering its command line options like this:

```
   kubelet <other-kubelet-options> --container-runtime=remote \
     --container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///var/run/cri-resmgr/cri-resmgr.sock
```

For CRI Resource Manager, you need to provide a configuration file, and also a
socket path if you don't use `containerd` or you run it with a different socket
path.

```
   # for containerd with default socket path
   cri-resmgr --force-config <config-file> --runtime-socket unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock
   # for cri-o
   cri-resmgr --force-config <config-file> --runtime-socket unix:///var/run/crio/crio.sock
```

The choice of policy to use along with any potential parameters specific to that
policy are taken from the configuration file. You can take a look at the
[sample configurations](sample-configs) for some minimal/trivial examples. For instance,
you can use [sample-configs/memtier-policy.cfg](sample-configs/memtier-policy.cfg)
as `<config-file>` to activate the topology aware policy with memory tiering support.

**NOTE**: Currently the available policies are work in progress.

### Setting Up kubelet To Use CRI Resource Manager as the Runtime

To let CRI Resource Manager act as a proxy between kubelet and the CRI runtime
you need to configure kubelet to connect to CRI Resource Manager instead of
the runtime. You do this by passing extra command line options to kubelet like
this:

```
   kubelet <other-kubelet-options> --container-runtime=remote \
     --container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///var/run/cri-resmgr/cri-resmgr.sock
```

## Setting Up CRI Resource Manager

Setting up CRI Resource Manager involves pointing it to your runtime and
providing it with a configuration. Pointing to the runtime is done using
the `--runtime-socket <path>` and, optionally, the `--image-socket <path>`.

For providing a configuration there are two options:

  1. use a local configuration YAML file
  2. use the CRI Resource Manager Agent and a `ConfigMap`

The former is easier to set up and it is also the preferred way to run CRI
Resource Manager for development, and in some cases testing. Setting up the
latter is a bit more involved but it allows you to

  - manage policy configuration for your cluster as a single source, and
  - dynamically update that configuration

### Using a Local Configuration From a File

This is the easiest way to run CRI Resource Manager for development or testing.
You can do it with the following command:

```
   cri-resmgr --force-config <config-file> --runtime-socket <path>
```

When started this way CRI Resource Manager reads its configuration from the
given file. It also disables its agent interface for external configuration
and updates.

### Using CRI Resource Manager Agent and a ConfigMap

This setup requires an extra component, the CRI Resource Manager Node Agent,
to monitor and fetch configuration from the ConfigMap and pass it on to CRI
Resource Manager. By default CRI Resource Manager will automatically try to
use the agent to acquire configuration, unless you override this by forcing
a static local configuration using the `--force-config <config-file>` option.
When using the agent, it is also possible to provide an initial fallback for
configuration using the `--fallback-config <config-file>`. This file will be
use before the very first configuration is successfully acquired from the
agent.

See the [later chapter](#cri-resource-manager-node-agent) about how to set
up and configure the agent.


## CRI Resource Manager Mutating Webhook

By default CRI Resource Manager does not see the original container *resource
requirements* specified in the *Pod Spec*. It tries to calculate these for `cpu`
and `memory` *compute resource*s using the related parameters present in the
CRI container creation request. The resulting estimates are normally accurate
for `cpu`, and also for `memory` `limits`. However, it is not possible to use
these parameters to estimate `memory` `request`s or any *extended resource*s.

If you want to make sure that CRI Resource Manager uses the origin *Pod Spec*
*resource requirement*s, you need to duplicate these as *annotations* on the Pod.
This is necessary if you plan using or writing a policy which needs *extended
resource*s.

This process can be fully automated using the [CRI Resource Manager Annotating
Webhook](cmd/cri-resmgr-webhook). Once you built the docker image for it using
the [provided Dockerfile][cmd/cri-resmgr-webhook/Dockerfile] and published it,
you can set up the webhook with these commands:

```
  kubectl apply -f cmd/cri-resmgr-webhook/mutating-webhook-config.yaml
  kubectl apply -f cmd/cri-resmgr-webhook/webhook-deployment.yaml

```


## CRI Resource Manager Node Agent

CRI Resource Manager can be configured dynamically using the CRI Resource
Manager Node Agent and Kubernetes ConfigMaps. The agent can be build using
the [provided Dockerfile](cmd/cri-resmgr-agent/Dockerfile). It can be deployed
as a `DaemonSet` in the cluster using the [provided deployment file](cmd/cri-resmgr-agent/agent-deployment.yaml).

To run the agent manually or as a `systemd` service, set the environment variable
`NODE_NAME` to the name of the cluster node the agent is running on. If necessary
pass it the credentials for accessing the cluster using the the `-kubeconfig <file>`
command line option.

The agent monitors two ConfigMaps for the node, a primary node-specific one, and
a secondary group-specific or default one, depending on whether the node belongs
to a configuration group. The node-specific ConfigMap always takes precedence over
the others.

The names of these ConfigMaps are

1. `cri-resmgr-config.node.$NODE_NAME`: primary, node-specific configuration
2. `cri-resmgr-config.group.$GROUP_NAME`: secondary group-specific node configuration
3. `cri-resmgr-config.default`: secondary: secondary default node configuration

You can assign a node to a configuration group by setting the
`cri-resource-manager.intel.com/group` label on the node to the name of
the configuration group. You can remove a node from its group by deleting the node
group label.

There is a [sample ConfigMap spec](sample-configs/cri-resmgr-configmap.example.yaml)
that contains anode-specific, a group-specific, and a default ConfigMap examples.
See [any available policy-specific documentation](docs) for more information on the
policy configurations.


## Using CRI Resource Manager as a Message Dumper

You can use CRI Resource Manager to simply inspect all proxied CRI requests and
responses without applying any policy. Run CRI Resource Manager with the
provided [sample configuration](sample-configs/cri-full-message-dump.cfg)
for doing this.


## Using Docker as the Runtime

If you must use `docker` as the runtime then the proxying setup is slightly more
complex. Docker does not natively support the CRI API. Normally kubelet runs an
internal protocol translator, `dockershim` to translate between CRI and the
native docker API. To let CRI Resource Manager effectively proxy between kubelet
and `docker` it needs to actually proxy between kubelet and `dockershim`. For this to
be possible, you need to run two instances of kubelet:

  1. real instance talking to CRI Resource Manager/CRI
  2. dockershim instance, acting as a CRI-docker protocol translator

The real kubelet instance you run as you would normally with any other real CRI
runtime, but you specify the dockershim socket for the CRI Image Service:

```
   kubelet <other-kubelet-options> --container-runtime=remote \
     --container-runtime-endpoint=unix:///var/run/cri-resmgr/cri-resmgr.sock \
     --image-service-endpoint=unix:///var/run/dockershim.sock
```

The dockershim instance you run like this, picking the cgroupfs driver according
to your real kubelet instance's configuration:

```
  kubelet --experimental-dockershim --port 11250 --cgroup-driver {systemd|cgroupfs}

```

## Logging and Debugging

You can control logging and debugging with the `--logger-*` command line options. By
default debug logs are globally disabled. You can turn on full debug logs with the
`--logger-debug '*'` command line option.
